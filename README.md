# RainyDays_Course-Assignment

This is the development of the website for 'RainyDays' after developing the prototype using Figma.

## Description

This is a responsive web page built for my course assignement at Noroff (Netlify link below). For this project, I was required to make a design using Figma for both desktop and mobile viewing (Link to prototypes below). This design was based on a case provided (information below) with a requirement to develop several key pages listed below. Next, using HTML and CSS, I developed the desktop prototype into a functional and responsive web page.
