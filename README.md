# RainyDays_Course-Assignment

This is the development of the website for 'RainyDays' after developing the prototype using Figma.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

This is a responsive web page built for my course assignement at Noroff. For this project, I was required to make a design using Figma for both desktop and mobile viewing (Link to prototypes below). This design was based on a case provided (information below) with a requirement to develop pages listed below. Next, using HTML and CSS, I was required to develop the desktop prototype into a functional and responsive web page.

Desktop prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/toSiViskvG55Bpd5cFsTnz/Course-Assignment---Rainy-Days?node-id=74%3A670&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=2%3A3&starting-point-node-id=10%3A113

Mobile app prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/toSiViskvG55Bpd5cFsTnz/Course-Assignment---Rainy-Days?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1%3A2&starting-point-node-id=143%3A108

Case: men and women age 30-50 whose interests are outdoors, hiking, exploring, skiing, camping and canoeing.
Site architecture: Home, list of jackets, specific jacket page, checkout page + success, about page and contact page.
